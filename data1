    "title": "Advantage",
    "data": "Having seen the good features of MongoDB, now every developer should be able to understand why it is better to use NoSQL based database for big data transactions and for implementing a scalable model. Now, its time to leave behind the schema definitions of RDBMS and get an advantage of using schema-less databases like MongoDB. Let us see some of the vital advantages of MongoDB ",
    "subtype1": "Advantages of MongoDB ",
    "data1": "First and foremost, it is very easy to install and setup the MongoDB.\n\n1. The very basic feature of MongoDB is that it is a schema-less database. No schema migrations anymore. Since MongoDB is schema-free, your code defines your schema.\n2. The ability to derive a document-based data model is one of the most attractive advantages of MongoDB. Because, the way it stores the data in the form of BSON (Binary JSON), ruby hashes etc, helps to store the data in a very rich way while being capable of holding arrays and other documents.\n3. The document query language supported by MongoDB plays a vital role in supporting dynamic queries.\n4. Very easy to scale.\n5. Due to the structuring (BSON format - key value pair) way of the data in MongoDB, no complex joins are needed.\n6. Performance tuning is absolutely easy compared to any relational databases.\n7. No need of mapping the application objects to the data objects.\nEnables faster access of the data due to its nature of using the internal memory for the storage.\n8. Since, it is a NOSQL database, then it is obviously secure because no sql injection can be made.\n9. MongoDB can also be used as a file system, which helps in easier way of load balancing.\n10. MongoDB supports, the search by regex and fields as well.\nMongoDB can be run as windows service as well.\n11. Good amount of documentation is available.\n12. MongoDB does not require a VM to be run.\n13. MongoDB follows regular release cycle of its newer versions.\n14. The support for Sharding is one of its key feature. Sharding is the process of storing the data in different machines and MongoDB's ability to process the data, as and when the size of the data grows. This results in the horizontal scaling. With sharding, more amount of data can be written and read back as and when there is an increase in the data growth.",

    "title": "Is MongoDB really Schemaless?",
    "data": "By now it is well known that the MongoDB is Schemaless. We need to understand what is that makes the MongoDB beahve as a schemaless database.\n\nEvery RDBMS database will possess a structure with respect to persisting the data. So, when the database needs to be modified, say a column of particular table needs to be modified(changing the datatype) or adding/removing a column from a table, we have to mention, what type of data this column will hold.\n\nBut, MongoDB is a document based database, which does not use the concept of tables and columns, instead of which it uses the concept of documents and collections. All the referential data with respect to different modules will be stored as one collection. More over the BSON data structure used by MongoDB can easily have varying sets of data and fields with different types.\n\nWhen we say schemaless, we actually mean dynamically typed schema, as opposed to statically typed schemas as available in RDBMS(SQL) databases.\n\nJSON is a completely schema free data structure, as opposed to XML which allows you to specify XSD if you need.\n\nWhenever we store something in MongoDB, we know what we are storing, its a String, Int or a custome Object in JSON format, and as soon as we try to store it in a collection, MongoDB accepts it as a JSON formatted data.\n\nAnd when you read somewhere that data migration is easy in NoSQL databases, its also not absolutely true. There are certain scenarios where document based databases like MongoDB proves to be better, but there are scenarios where SQL based databases have the upper hand. For example : data processing while migrating, takes longer in case of NoSQL due to data duplication, while in a Normalised SQL database, minimal data duplication is there.",

So let's create a folder named data and one more folder named db inside data folder as shown below.\nInstalling MongoDB on Windows\n\nAlso create a log folder to log the MongoDB data transactions. Under the log folder, create a log file FILE_NAME.log.\nNow, to verify whether the installation is successful or not, open the command prompt and navigate to the bin directory of the MongoDB installed folder.\nExecute the command mongod.exe --dbpath \"DATA_DIRECTORY_PATH\" to configure the data path and start the MongoDB server. Please replace the DATA_DIRECTORY_PATH with the path of data directory present inside MongoDB installed folder. On running this command, the below log will be displayed which says that the MongoDB configuration is successful and the server is up and running fine.\nInstalling MongoDB on Windows\n\nNow, open another command prompt window and navigate to the bin directory of the MongoDB again, and start the MongoDB client in order to use the database system. Run the command mongo in Command Prompt and it will get connected to the MongoDB where the default database is test.\nInstalling MongoDB on Windows\n\nWith this, we have successfully installed the MongoDB on the windows environment and we are good to start off with the MongoDB.",

    "title": "Data Modelling in MongoDB",
    "data": "As explained in the earlier lessons, data in MongoDB is schema-less, which means there is no need of defining a structure for the data before insertion. Since, MongoDB is a document based database, any document within the same collection is not mandatory to have same set of fields or structure. This helps in easily mapping the documents with the entity objects. In general, the documents in a collection of MongoDB will always share the same data structure(recommended for best performance, not mandatory).\n\nThe vital factor or challenge in modelling the data in a given database is load balancing and hence ensuring the performance aspect effectively. It is a mandate while modelling the data to consider the complete usage of data (CRUD operations) along with how the data will be inherited as well.\n\nThere are 2 ways in which the relationships between the data can be established in MongoDB:\n\n1. Reference Documents\n2. Embedded Documents\n",
    "subtype1": "MongoDB: Referenced Documents",
    "data1": "This is one of the ways to implement the relationship between data stored in different collections. In this, a reference to the data in one collection will be used in connecting the data between the collections.\n\nConsider 2 collections books and authors as shown below:\n\n\n{\n  title: \"Java in action\",\n  author: \"author1\",\n  language: \"English\",\n  publisher: {\n             name: \"My publications\",\n             founded:1990,\n             location: \"SF\"\n            }\n}\n\n{\n  title: \"Hibernate in action\",\n  author: \"author2\",\n  language: \"English\",\n  publisher: {\n             name: \"My publications\",\n             founded:1990,\n             location: \"SF\"\n            }\n}\n\n \nIn the above example, the publisher data is repeated. In order to avoid this repetition, we can add references of the book to the publisher data instead of using entire data of publisher in every book entry, as shown below:\n\n\n{\n  name: \"My Publciations\",\n  founded:1980,\n  location: \"CA\",\n  books: [111222333,444555666, ..]\n}\n\n{\n   _id:111222333,\n   title: \"Java in action\",\n   author: \"author1\",\n   language: \"English\"\n}\n\n{\n  _id:444555666,\n  title: \"Hibernate in action\",\n  author: \"author2\",\n  language: \"English\"\n}\nThis can be done the other way round as well, where in one can reference the publisher id in the books data, your choice.",

Use db.books.find() to list down the contents of the collection.\n\nAggregation in MongoDB\n\n\nNow, from the above collection, let us use the aggregate function to group the books which are of the type ebook and online. Following command will be used :\n\ndb.books.aggregate([{$group : {_id: \"$type\", category: {$sum : 1}}}])",

Since the mongodump is not actually command from mongodb shell, you need to execute the command as shown below.\n3.\tFrom the above screenshot observer that all the data from the collection mynewdatabase has been dumped.\n4.\tMongodump basically reads the data from the database and creates a BSON file in which the data is dumped. Mongodump writes only documents from the database. The resultant backup of the data will be of the space efficient.

Hence, a horizontal scaling of the data is required and sharding does this in MongoDB. Sharding in simple just adds more machines to handle the sudden or rapid growth of data in an application.\n\nNeed for Sharding in MongoDB :\n\nVertical scaling is too scaling\nIn data backup process all the data will be written to the master nodes.\nSpace in local disk may not be huge enough to handle the data growth.",
